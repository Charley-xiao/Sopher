Top 10 and Top 100 Desired Articles
Below are two lists, one of the top 10 and the other of the top 100 articles that we would like to publish. For more suggestions of articles you might write, see the list:
Desired articles for each area of philosophy.
Philosophy faculty members from any country are welcome to propose writing on these topics or on a topic that is not on any of these lists. Avoid narrow topics that are common in philosophical journals, and avoid promoting one’s own original idea. All expected due dates for completion of an article need to be 12 months or less.
The Encyclopedia also is seeking specialized articles rather than overview articles on all the most influential philosophers of earlier centuries, such as Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Mill, James, Russell, Wittgenstein, Husserl, Heidegger, and Quine.
Top 10 desired articles:



Augustine
Bradley, F. H.
Determinism
Empiricism, British
Ethics: Contemporary
Hellenistic Philosophy
Idealism
Plato: Forms
Positivism, Logical
Science, Philosophy of



The above 10 articles require a word count of about 12,000-20,000 words. Authors of any article need a Ph.D. in philosophy plus some evidence of expertise in the area such as having published an article in the area in a professional journal or having written a dissertation on the topic.
